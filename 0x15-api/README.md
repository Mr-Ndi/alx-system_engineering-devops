An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is essentially a set of tools, protocols, and routines that enable different software programs to communicate with each other. Python is a popular programming language that developers usually prefer to work with APIs due to its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful libraries specially designed for working with JSON data and making HTTP requests. In Python, the requests library is a common choice for making API requests since it simplifies the process of handling responses and sending HTTP requests.
