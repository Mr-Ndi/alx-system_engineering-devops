Some basic explanation t of the main components are of the developed server web infrastructure are:


I.Explanation of the Components:



1.|---> Server: Simply this can be defined as the hardware or the software that provides some service to, or respond to the question other computers called clients

2.|---> The role of the DN (Domain Name) is that it helps in converting IP address into human readable so as to reach or access the content of ceertain website without memorizing entire the complicated IP address

3.|--> The type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com is A record (Address record)

4.|--> Simply the role of the web server is to:
                                                ---> handle the HTTP(S) request
                                                ---> Serve static web content
                                                ---> Forward dynamic content request to the application server

5.--> And in short the role of the application server is to :
                                                             --> Process Dynamic request
                                                             --> Executes applicatiom codes
                                                             --> Communicate wit the database

6.--> The role of the database is to store and manages data for the application.

7.--> Then the server that we use to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website is called Webserver



II.  Issues with the Infrastructure:


1.--> Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
                                    --> Component: Domain Name (DN).
                                    --> Explanation: If the DN fails, it can prevent the translation of hostnames to IP addresses, disrupting the entire network

2.--> Downtime During Maintenance:
                                --> Issue: Not elaborated on in the provided content.
                                --> Generally, restarting the web server for maintenance may lead to downtime. Strategies like load balancing can help minimize this

3.--> About Scaling Challenges with High Traffic:
                                                --> Issue: Not explained in detail.
                                                --> Explanation: If the infrastructure cannot scale efficiently, it may struggle to handle a large influx of incoming traffic. Scaling solutions like load balancing, horizontal scaling, and content delivery networks (CDNs) can address this.
